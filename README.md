# Base Node

Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built on Optimism's open-source [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/). This repository contains Docker builds to run your own node on the Base network.

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have an Ethereum L1 full node RPC available (not Base)
2. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. **Configure**: Edit `.env` to set:
   - Network: `NETWORK=mainnet` or `NETWORK=sepolia`
   - Client: `CLIENT=geth` or `CLIENT=reth`
   - L1 endpoints and other required values
4. **Run**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
5. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}' \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
   ```

## Supported Networks

| Base Network      | Status | Node Type | Client |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------- | ------ |
| Testnet (Sepolia) | âœ…     | Full      | Geth   |
| Mainnet           | âœ…     | Full      | Geth   |
| Mainnet           | âœ…     | Archive   | Reth   |

**Note:** Archive nodes are only supported with Reth client. Geth nodes are full nodes only.

## Environment Files

The configuration is organized into four files:

- `.env` - Base configuration with network and client selection
- `.env.geth` - Geth-specific configurations
- `.env.reth` - Reth-specific configurations
- `.env.example` - Template showing required values

The `.env` file automatically sources the appropriate client configuration based on your `CLIENT` selection.

### Required Configuration

The following values must be set in your environment:

- `NETWORK` - Network to connect to (`mainnet` or `sepolia`)
- `CLIENT` - Client to use (`geth` or `reth`)
- `OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC` - Your L1 Ethereum node RPC URL
- `OP_NODE_L1_BEACON` - Your L1 Ethereum beacon node URL (required for both clients)
- `OP_NODE_L1_BEACON_ARCHIVER` - (Reth archive nodes only) Your L1 blob archiver URL for historical data access

**Note:** For Reth archive nodes, you need both beacon endpoints:

- `OP_NODE_L1_BEACON` for current consensus data
- `OP_NODE_L1_BEACON_ARCHIVER` for historical blob data (Dencun upgrade)

### Sync Mode Configuration

By default, both Geth and Reth nodes use execution layer syncing (`OP_NODE_SYNCMODE=execution-layer`). This mode:

- Syncs from the execution layer first
- Provides faster initial sync times
- Is recommended for most users

For experimental features, you can enable:

- Snap sync for Geth: `OP_GETH_SYNCMODE=snap`

### Geth Configuration Options

For Geth nodes, you can configure the following options in `.env.geth`:

- `DB_ENGINE` - Database engine to use: `pebble` (default, recommended) or `leveldb`
- `GETH_CACHE` - Memory cache size in MB
- `GETH_TXPOOL_GLOBALQUEUE` - Maximum number of non-executable transaction slots for all accounts
- `GETH_TXPOOL_GLOBALSLOTS` - Maximum number of executable transaction slots for all accounts
- `HOST_IP` - External IP address for NAT traversal (defaults to 0.0.0.0)

### Reth Configuration Options

For Reth nodes, you can configure the following options in `.env.reth`:

- `HOST_IP` - External IP address for NAT traversal (defaults to 0.0.0.0)

## Hardware Requirements

### Geth Full Nodes

- AWS Instance: i4i.12xlarge
- Storage: raid0 of all local nvme drives with ext4 filesystem
- Base team runs Geth with Pebbledb for full nodes

### Reth Archive Nodes

- AWS Instance: i7ie.6xlarge
- Disk: Raid0 of both disks (/dev/nvme1n1,/dev/nvme2n1)
- Filesystem: ext4

### Other Clients

- Modern multi-core CPU with good single-core performance
- At least 16 GB RAM (32 GB recommended)
- Locally attached NVMe SSD drive
- Storage: (2 Ã— current_chain_size) + snapshot_size + 20% buffer

**Note:** For Amazon EBS, use `io2 block express` to avoid latency issues during sync.

## Docker Configuration

The repository includes Docker configurations for both Geth and Reth clients:

- `geth/` - Contains Geth-specific Dockerfile and entrypoint scripts
- `reth/` - Contains Reth-specific Dockerfile and entrypoint scripts

Each client folder contains:

- `Dockerfile` - Builds the client and op-node
- `geth-entrypoint`/`reth-entrypoint` - Execution service entrypoint
- `op-geth-entrypoint`/`op-reth-entrypoint` - Op-node service entrypoint

## Data Persistence

By default, data is stored in `${PROJECT_ROOT}/${CLIENT}-data`. You can override this by modifying `HOST_DATA_DIR` in `.env`.

To load a snapshot, extract it into the `$HOST_DATA_DIR` folder. See [Base docs](https://docs.base.org/guides/run-a-base-node/#snapshots) for snapshot URLs.

## Single Container Mode

For Kubernetes or other single-container deployments, use the `supervisord` entrypoint:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -e OP_NODE_L2_ENGINE_RPC=ws://localhost:8551 -e OP_NODE_RPC_PORT=7545 ghcr.io/base-org/node:latest
```

## Syncing

Sync speed depends on your L1 node. Check sync status with:

```bash
curl -s -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
```
